# 🛡️ SMS Spam Detector: AI‑Powered Message Guardian

> **Is that message a Gift 🎁 or a Trap 🪤?**
> An intelligent, AI‑powered system that instantly detects whether an SMS is **Ham (legitimate)** or **Spam (fraudulent/unwanted)** using Natural Language Processing.

## 📌 Project Overview

The **SMS Spam Detector** is a sophisticated text‑classification engine built to protect users from spam, phishing attempts, and fraudulent messages. It uses a **Multinomial Naive Bayes** model—an industry‑standard algorithm known for its efficiency and accuracy in NLP‑based document classification.

The application is wrapped in a **sleek Streamlit interface**, offering real‑time predictions, visual feedback, and an intuitive user experience.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1️⃣ Text Vectorization (TF‑IDF)

Incoming messages are transformed into numerical vectors using **Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency (TF‑IDF)**. This process highlights important spam‑related keywords such as *winner*, *urgent*, *cash*, and *prize*, while filtering out common filler words.

### 2️⃣ Probabilistic Classification

The processed text is passed to a **Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier**, which applies **Bayes’ Theorem** to calculate the probability of a message being Spam or Ham. The trained model and vectorizer are stored in serialized files (`model.pkl`, `vectorizer.pkl`).

## 🧪 Example Tests

| Message Type | Input Sample                                                 | Prediction |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| 🚨 Spam      | "WINNER! You have won a £1000 prize. Call 0905... to claim!" | SPAM       |
| ✅ Ham        | "Hey, are we still meeting for coffee at 4 PM?"              | HAM        |
